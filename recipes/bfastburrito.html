<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>12 eggs</li>
    <li>2/3 cups of milk</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>1 lb pork sausage</li>
    <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 red onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>3.5 oz diced jalapenos</li>
    <li>1 oz taco seasoning</li>
    <li>1.5 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>20 (6 inch) flour or corn tortillas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt in a large bowl. Heat butter in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Pour the egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes.
        Chop the cooked eggs and place in a large bowl. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and stir in the sausage and garlic. Cook and stir for 5 minutes
        then add the onion. Continue cooking and stirring until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no 
        longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Combine the sausage with the eggs, tomato, cilantro,
        jalapeno, and taco seasoning. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature then stir in the cheddar cheese.
    </li>
    <li>Place a tortilla onto your workspace and spoon some of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and
        center of the tortilla. Flatten the filling to filling into a rectangle shape. Fold the bottom of the 
        tortilla snugly over the filling then fold in the left and right edges. Roll the burrito up to the top
        edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>Tightly wrap individual burritos with plastic wrap and freeze until ready to serve. Heat in the microwave
        until hot for 3-4 minutes before serving.
